# Updated Development Plan: Mastering the Main Flow

## Phase 1: Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

_Foundation for intelligent analysis_

### 1.1 Data Profiler

- Automatic profiling on file upload
- Column-by-column analysis (types, distributions, missing values)
- Relationship detection within single files
- Data quality assessment
- Store profile in memory for AI context

### 1.2 Query Suggestions

- Generate 5-7 smart suggestions based on data profile
- Update suggestions after each Q&A exchange
- Show suggestions in UI as clickable chips
- Base suggestions on data patterns found

### 1.3 Basic Code Execution with LangChain

- Integrate pandas agent for actual calculations
- Execute simple analyses (sums, averages, groupings)
- Return both results and generated code
- Show code in collapsible section for transparency

## Phase 2: Multi-File Foundation (Week 3-4)

_The crucial complexity that makes it real_

### 2.1 Multi-File Upload & Management

- Modify UI to support multiple CSV uploads per project
- Display all uploaded files in Data Studio tab
- Show file relationships diagram/list
- Allow file deletion and replacement
- Store multiple DataFrames in backend memory

### 2.2 Relationship Definition

- Add "Relationships" section to Context tab
- Let users describe how files connect in natural language
- Auto-detect potential join keys based on column names/types
- Store relationship mappings: "customers.id = orders.customer_id"
- Validate relationships (check if keys actually match)

### 2.3 Multi-File Chat Context

- Modify system prompt to include all file schemas
- Pass relationship information to AI
- Create merged context: "You have access to 3 tables: sales (1000 rows), customers (200 rows), products (50 rows). They relate as follows..."
- Let AI determine which file(s) to use for each question

### 2.4 Cross-File Analysis Execution

- Implement pandas merge/join operations based on defined relationships
- Handle questions that span files: "Show me revenue by customer segment"
- Auto-join tables when needed for analysis
- Show which files were used in each answer

## Phase 3: Core Conversation Intelligence (Week 5-6)

_Making the analysis flow natural and powerful_

### 3.1 Context Preservation & Memory

- Maintain conversation state within session
- Track referenced entities: "the top product" â†’ SKU001
- Build running context of findings
- Allow references to previous answers: "Why did that happen?"

### 3.2 Working Dataset State

- Implement filter persistence: "Focus on Q4 data" applies to subsequent questions
- Show active filters in UI
- Allow clearing filters: "Show all data again"
- Stack filters: "Now just show electronics" adds to existing filters

### 3.3 Multi-Step Reasoning

- Break complex questions into steps
- Show reasoning chain in UI:
  ```
  Question: "What's my most profitable customer segment?"
  Step 1: Calculate profit per transaction
  Step 2: Join with customer data
  Step 3: Group by segment
  Step 4: Calculate total profit per segment
  ```
- Execute each step with pandas agent
- Allow drilling into any step

### 3.4 Progressive Depth Analysis

- Implement "why" and "how" follow-ups
- When user asks "why did sales drop?":
  - Automatically analyze all dimensions
  - Compare periods
  - Look for correlations
  - Present hypotheses ranked by evidence

## Phase 4: Analysis Intelligence (Week 7-8)

_Ensuring quality and trust in the analysis_

### 4.1 Validation & Assumptions

- Detect ambiguous column references
- Confirm interpretations: "By 'revenue', I'm using the 'total_amount' column. Is this correct?"
- Validate operations before execution
- Check for data type mismatches

### 4.2 Confidence & Error Handling

- Add confidence scores to answers
- Explain impact of missing data
- Provide alternative approaches when analysis fails
- Suggest data needed for better analysis

### 4.3 Comparative Analysis

- Handle time comparisons: "vs last month"
- Segment comparisons: "compare A to B"
- Maintain comparison context
- Show side-by-side results in structured format

### 4.4 Analysis Breadcrumbs

- Show data lineage for each answer
- Track transformations applied
- Make analysis reproducible
- Build trust through transparency

## Implementation Priority & Complexity

```
HIGH IMPACT + LOWER COMPLEXITY (Do First):
- Data Profiler
- Query Suggestions
- Multi-file upload
- Basic code execution

HIGH IMPACT + HIGHER COMPLEXITY (Do Second):
- Relationship management
- Cross-file analysis
- Context preservation
- Multi-step reasoning

IMPORTANT BUT CAN REFINE LATER:
- Confidence scoring
- Advanced error handling
- Analysis breadcrumbs
- Comparative analysis
```

## Success Metrics for Main Flow Mastery

**Phase 1 Success**: Users can upload a file and get instant insights about their data structure and quality, with the AI executing real calculations.

**Phase 2 Success**: Users can upload related files (e.g., sales + customers + products) and ask questions that naturally span across them.

**Phase 3 Success**: Users can have a flowing conversation where each question builds on previous insights, with the system maintaining context and handling complex, multi-step analyses.

**Phase 4 Success**: Users trust the system because it validates assumptions, expresses confidence appropriately, and provides transparent reasoning.

## Technical Notes

**Backend Architecture Changes Needed**:

- Upgrade from single file storage to multi-file management
- Implement relationship mapping system
- Add conversation state management
- Create analysis pipeline that can chain operations

**LangChain Integration Strategy**:

- Start with pandas agent for single-file operations
- Extend to handle pre-joined DataFrames for multi-file
- Add custom tools for specific operations
- Build conversation memory with LangChain's memory modules

**Critical Decision Points**:

1. **How to handle large files?** Set limits initially (e.g., 100MB per file)
2. **How many files to support?** Start with 5 files max per project
3. **How to manage relationships?** Begin with simple foreign key mappings
4. **Memory management?** Clear conversation history after 50 exchanges

This plan focuses entirely on making the core analysis conversation excellent. No visualizations, no exports, no scheduling - just pure analytical conversation mastery with real-world multi-file data scenarios.
